			<p class="funfacts">The Exotic shorthair hair is a loving lap cat with a somewhat more lively personality than the Persian. They tend to follow their owners around the house and will jump into your lap as much as possible.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Scientific Name</span>: Felis catus</li>
				<li><span>Average Length</span>: 15 inches</li>
				<li><span>Average Lifespan</span>: 8 to 15 years</li>
				<li><span>Habitat</span>: Human domicile</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Exotic shorthair was originally intended to be a silver cat and was going to be called the Sterling, but today he is found in all the same colors and patterns as the Persian: solid, silver and golden, shaded and smoke, tabby, particolor, bicolor and Himalayan. His short coat is easily cared for with a weekly brushing.</p>
